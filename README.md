# Finding an Airbnb in New York City
 
Status: Completed

## Objective
Scenario: Paola is heading to New York in less than a month and is desperate to find a place to stay during her 5-day trip to the city that never sleeps. Your job is to help her filter through Airbnb to find an accomodation that fits her criteria and, most importantly, her tight budget. Make sure to deliver a visual presentation for her to evaluate her options.

## Technologies
- Tableau

## Project Description
For this work I used Airbnb's open data cleaned by Sandeep Majumdar and available at Kaggle. The dataset contains information of almost 70k Airbnb's accomodation offers in New York City, specifying Cancellation Policy, Host details, NeighborHood, Room Type, Number of Reviews, Price information and others.
